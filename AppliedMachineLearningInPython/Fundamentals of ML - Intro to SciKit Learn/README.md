# Fundamentals of ML - Intro to SciKit Learn

## Introduction:

	- ML ~ Statistical methods + computer science
	- Examples: fraud detection, purchase recognition and advertising, etc.
	- Applied ML: understand basi ML concepts and workflows and how to properly apply black-box ML components and features.

## Key concepts in ML

	- Supervised ML: learn to predict target values from labelled data. Two examples are **Classification**, whose target values are discrete classes, and **Regression**, whose target values are continuous values.
	- Unsupervised ML: find structure in unlabeled data (finding clusters, detecting abnormalities/ outliers detection, etc.)

	Normal ML workflow: starts by the representation of the problem (features, type of classifiers, etc.). Then, it need a evaluation criterion to distinguish bad from good classfication. The last step it to optimize, meaning getting the classfier that gets the best result for an specific evaluation criterion.
